# Boids2D
I made a 2D Boids simulation in Unity.
This was my first "real" Unity project so it's features are limited, however, it is still pretty cool. The simulation allows you to tinker with the 3 boids behaviours: (1) Cohesion, (2) Seperation and (3) Alignment and see active changes in the boids behaviours. <br/> I have been entertaining the idea of making a 3D boids simulation. That being said, my Unity knowledge is anything but extensive so I will have to wait until I have more time to devote to Unity before I can explore the idea.
